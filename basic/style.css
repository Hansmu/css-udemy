    /* Browsers have default fonts matching with certain values. For example with Chrome you have Helvetica
    matching with sans-serif. sans-serif, serif and monospace are always great values as they use the
    browser defaults. However, if you want to use a specific font, then you have to take a different approach.
    For example Google Fonts could be used to include fonts that don't exist by default. */
