CSS3 is the latest version of CSS. There won't be a CSS4 as the way CSS is developed
has changed. CSS3 contains modules that have different versions.

CSS is case insensitive, so using camel case names would have no value.

CSS uses a box model. It means that every element 
is a box. It consists of the content, padding, border
and margin.

* Padding comes right after the content and is between
the border and the content.

* Margin is the area that is outside of the border.
